# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** The compiler must correctly translate all v0.1 EAML constructs into runnable Python that type-checks, imports cleanly, and calls LLM APIs when executed.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Error Foundation and Lexer

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Error Foundation and Lexer)
Plan: 2 of 3 in current phase (completed)
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-15 -- Completed 01-02 core lexer

Progress: [#######...] 67%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: 6 min
- Total execution time: 0.20 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-error-foundation-and-lexer | 2 | 12 min | 6 min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*
| Phase 01 P02 | 8 | 2 tasks | 11 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Logos for lexer with wrapper layer for template string mode switching (from research)
- NodeId-based side tables for semantic annotations, not mutable AST (from research)
- Hand-written CodeWriter for Python codegen, genco rejected (Rust 1.88+ requirement)
- New lexer error codes assigned as SYN001-004 from reserved range (01-01)
- DiagnosticCollector counts Fatal severity toward error limit alongside Error (01-01)
- All strings tokenized as template strings at lexer level to avoid context-sensitivity (01-02)
- Logos wrapper uses fixed base offset per scan pass to avoid span corruption (01-02)
- PythonBridge mode scans for }% at line-start with optional whitespace (01-02)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Lexer mode switching for template strings: RESOLVED -- wrapper layer with brace-depth tracking works correctly (01-02)
- Python bridge `}%` delimiter: f-string edge case `f"{value}% done"` can produce false close (spec errata) -- mitigated by line-start-only matching (01-02)
